## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Workflow  

This project uses a structured data operation and abstraction design to handle data efficiently:

### Data Acquisition  
- Data is retrieved from the [BLS Public Data API](https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm).  
- An API key is used to access detailed historical data.  
- Specific BLS series IDs are used for staples like milk, bread, flour, and eggs.

### Data Transformation  
- Data is normalized into consistent units for analysis.  
- Missing values are addressed through interpolation or exclusion.  
- Time series data is aligned for accurate comparisons.

### Integration and Analysis  
- A modular design simplifies data retrieval and preparation.  
- The app dynamically fetches and visualizes the data using Streamlit.
